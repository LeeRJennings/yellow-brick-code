            <h2>The Wizard of Oz is a Musical</h2>
            <p>When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, Toto, are whisked away in their house to the magical land of Oz. 
                They follow the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to meet the Wizard, and en route they meet a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) that needs a brain, 
                a Tin Man (Jack Haley) missing a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. The wizard asks the group to bring him the broom 
                of the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) to earn his help.</p>

                <div><img src="/images/manbehindcurtain.jpg" alt="The Man Behind the Curtain from Wiazrd of Oz"></div>
                <p>In a shocking turn of events The Wizard of Oz is not a Wizard. Thanks to the work of Dorothy from Kansas and her friends it has been revealed the Wizard we've know and feared for years is actually just some guy who was hanging out behind a curtain. He apparently used a projector, two smoke machines, and a basic understanding of Microsoft Paint to create the illusion. This man from behind the curtain declined to comment. More on this as the story develops.</p>
